Newest-first ledger of notable decisions, learnings, and preferences —

## 2026-07-04: Governance uplift — gates, learning loop, and the Claude bridge

**Context.** The AOS-generation governance layer retrofitted onto this repo's
existing Codex-first AI Stack, on branch `governance/aos-uplift` (five staged
commits, not pushed).

**Decisions.**
- `docs/STANDARDS.md` adopted with the owner's consent (bundled in the
  approved plan): tool-registry wiring, catalog pipeline coverage,
  PROMPT_ROLES drift, browser trust boundary, no injection primitives, skill
  pins, gate ledger, gov:node graph truth, two skill homes, consent gate.
- Two skill homes (STANDARDS §3.4): `.agents/skills/` stays the untouched
  Codex set; `.claude/skills/` carries the curated sharp set (12 bridged
  byte-identical + 3 additions + the `/digi` router). GSAP suite and Taste
  collection deliberately not bridged (no gsap dependency).
- Full wiring from day one: both checks on `prebuild` (joining
  `data:validate`), `.githooks/pre-commit`, and CI.
- AGENTS.md upgraded in place; rules 1-17, the three layers, and skill
  routing preserved verbatim (verified by diff). Rules 18-21 added for the
  gates + graph truth.
- The theme-bootstrap `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `src/app/layout.tsx` is
  the sole §2.4 allowlist entry (module-level constant, two-value
  localStorage check); growing the list needs consent.

**Learnings.**
- The repo's own generator already had a `--check` mode
  (`generateRoleDocs({check:true})`) — the drift gate reuses it instead of
  duplicating render logic.
- The browser trust boundary is currently a bare cast:
  `src/lib/prompt-session.ts` (`JSON.parse(...) as Partial<PromptSession>`)
  and `src/lib/prompt-storage.ts` (`JSON.parse(raw) as T`) validate nothing.
  Recorded as standing audit points in the security gate. Hardening them —
  sharpening §2.3 from "validated" to "validated via the catalog schema or a
  typed guard" — is the first recommended follow-up (proposed amendment,
  needs the owner's consent).

**Preferences.**
- Branch + staged commits, no push: pushing/merging `governance/aos-uplift`
  is the owner's call.
